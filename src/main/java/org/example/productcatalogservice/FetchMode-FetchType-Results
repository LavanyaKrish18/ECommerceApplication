//Hypothesis
Fetch Mode JOIN has dominance over any fetch type
Incase of Fetch mode select and subselect, Fetch type gets the dominance

    subselect 1 category = parent -> n children. Hence subquery not required here
    [Clue: When you have 2 loops subqueries will work]
    collection / batch fetching - subquery works, 1 row - doesn't work

// Only fetch type results
        //Fetch type of Category class - products field is Lazy
            // If asked for products 2 queries - fetch category and products tables
            // If not asked for products 1 query - fetch category table
        //Fetch type of Category class - products field is Eager - Run 1 left join query
            // If asked for products 2 queries - fetch category and products tables
            // If not asked for products 2 queries - fetch category and products tables
